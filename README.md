# CellMorphology

This repository contains my computer vision code for quantifying the shape-changes in a collection of cells. 

This MATLAB code takes essential characteristics extracted from the input video file, and then uses these attributes to quantify the aspect ratio and offset angle of each cell. It then synthesizes the information from all the cells to make determiniations about the pathological state of the tissue and the overall rotation of the microscope.
